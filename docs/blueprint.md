# **App Name**: TrustNet Guardian

## Core Features:

- AI-Powered Trust Assessor: The Agent Trust Evaluator feature continuously analyzes agent behavior using AI to identify anomalies, deviations from established patterns, and potential security risks based on a dynamic threat landscape, allowing TrustNet Guardian to make more accurate, real-time adjustments.
- Causal Chain Analyzer: Employ generative AI tool to analyze causal chains of agent actions, detecting patterns indicative of LPCI attacks. Provides alerts based on identified anomalies and potential breaches in system integrity and suggest preemptive security measures.
- Trust Dashboard: Displays real-time trust scores and detailed analytics on agent behavior.
- Causal Chain Visualization: Visualize causal relationships between agent actions and potential security threats.
- DID/VC Identity Management: Manage agent identities using Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs).
- Dynamic Access Control: Enforce dynamic access control policies based on agent trust scores and context.
- Trust-Adaptive Runtime: The framework adapts agent runtime environments, offering more or less restrictive permissions dynamically based on real-time trust levels, helping manage runtime security efficiently and reactively.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#673AB7) to evoke a sense of security and intelligence.
- Background color: Very light purple (#F3E5F5) for a clean, non-distracting interface.
- Accent color: Soft blue (#90CAF9) to highlight important information and actions.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font known for its modern, neutral, machined look, ensures legibility.
- Use clear, simple icons to represent different agent states, trust levels, and security actions. Ensure icons are easily distinguishable.
- The layout should be clean and intuitive, prioritizing critical information such as trust scores and potential threats. Use a grid-based system for consistent alignment.
- Subtle animations can be used to highlight changes in trust scores or the detection of anomalies. Avoid distracting or unnecessary animations.
